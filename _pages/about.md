I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.memphis.edu/cs/) in the University of Memphis starting from Fall 2024. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computing and Information Sciences at [Computational Biomedical Lab (CBL)](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/) from Rochester Insitute of Technology in 2024, advised by [Dr. Linwei Wang](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/linwei-wang/). I earned my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie within a broad area of **machine learning** and **health care**. More specifically, my research focuses on interdisciplinary directions of **adaptive computing in AI models**, **physics-informed deep learning**, and their applications on **health care**. Below are the research topics that I have been working on:

1. Learning to adapt high-dimensional time series forecasting ([ICLR 23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7C9aRX2nBf2)) and application on personalized virtual hearts ([MICCAI 22](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16452-1_5))
2. Integrating physics on deep learning models with application on electrocardiographic imaging ([TMI 24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10471622), [TMI 23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9932432), [MICCAI 21](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87231-1_35), [MICCAI 20](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_47))
3. Identifiable hybrid modeling ([arxiv 24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15433))
