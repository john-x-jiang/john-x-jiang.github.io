I will be joining as a tenure-track assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://csm.rowan.edu/departments/cs/) in Rowan University starting from Fall 2025. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computing and Information Sciences at [Computational Biomedical Lab (CBL)](https://www.rit.edu/cblwang/) from Rochester Insitute of Technology in 2024, advised by [Dr. Linwei Wang](https://www.rit.edu/cblwang/linwei-wang). I earned my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie within a broad area of **machine learning** and **health care**. More specifically, my research focuses on interdisciplinary directions of **adaptive computing in AI models**, **physics-informed deep learning**, and their applications on **health care**. Below are the research topics that I have been working on:

1. Learning to adapt high-dimensional time series forecasting ([ICLR 23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7C9aRX2nBf2)) and application on personalized virtual hearts ([MICCAI 22](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16452-1_5))
2. Integrating physics on deep learning models with application on electrocardiographic imaging ([TMI 24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10471622), [TMI 23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9932432))

<span style="color:red">**NOTE:**</span> I am actively hiring Ph.D. students to join my group. BS or MS students with a background in electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, applied statistics / mathematics, or related areas are welcome to apply. All the positions will be fully funded. Please feel free to contact me, and please include your **CV**, **transcripts**, and **a brief discription of research interest** to <font style="color:blue">**jiangx [at] rowan [dot] edu**</font> with the subject line "Prospective PhD Student [Your Name]".
