I will join the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.memphis.edu/cs/) at the University of Memphis as a tenure-track assistant professor in Fall 2024. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computing and Information Sciences at [Computational Biomedical Lab (CBL)](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/) from Rochester Insitute of Technology in 2024, advised by [Dr. Linwei Wang](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/linwei-wang/). I earned my master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California and bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie within a broad area of machine learning and health care. More specifically, my research focuses on interdisciplinary directions of adaptive computing in AI models, physics-informed deep learning, and their applications on health care.
